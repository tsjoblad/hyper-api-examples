This repo is the official home of the Hyper API examples. All of the samples are available for each language supported by the Hyper API: Python, Java, CPP, and DotNet. 

For the unfamiliar, the Hyper API contains a set of functions you can use to automate your interactions with Tableau extract (.hyper) files. You can use the API to create new extract files, or to open existing files, and then insert, delete, update, or read data from those files. Using the Hyper API developers and administrators can:
* Create extract files for data sources not currently supported by Tableau.
* Automate custom extract, transform and load (ETL) processes (for example, implement rolling window updates or custom incremental updates).
* Retrieve data from an extract file.


## What's in the samples?
There are currently eight samples that are available in each language supported:
* Create Hyper from CSV
* Delete Data in Existing Hyper File 
* Insert Data into Multiple Tables 
* Insert Data into Single Table 
* Insert Data with Expressions 
* Insert Spatial Data into Hyper File 
* Read and Print Data from Existing Hyper File 
* Update Data in Existing Hyper File
