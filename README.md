# Hyper API Code Examples
[![Tableau Supported](https://img.shields.io/badge/Support%20Level-Tableau%20Supported-53bd92.svg)](https://www.tableau.com/support-levels-it-and-developer-tools)


This repo is the home of the Hyper API example code. All of the examples are available for each language supported by the Hyper API: Python, Java, C++, and C#/.Net (.NET Standard 2.0). 

If you are looking to learn more about the Hyper API, please check out the [official documentation](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/hyper_api/en-us/index.html). 



## What is the Hyper API?
For the unfamiliar, the Hyper API contains a set of functions you can use to automate your interactions with Tableau extract (.hyper) files. You can use the API to create new extract files, or to open existing files, and then insert, delete, update, or read data from those files. Using the Hyper API developers and administrators can:
* Create extract files for data sources not currently supported by Tableau.
* Automate custom extract, transform and load (ETL) processes (for example, implement rolling window updates or custom incremental updates).
* Retrieve data from an extract file.



## What do these examples do?
There are currently eight examples that are available in each language supported:

* __create_hyper_file_from_csv__
  * Demonstrates how you can use the Hyper SQL COPY command to quickly populate a table in the .hyper file from the contents of a comma-separated value (CSV) file. This technique is the fastest way to bring data into an extract, as Hyper is reading data directly from the CSV file.

* __delete_data_from_existing_hyper_file__
  * Demonstrates how you can use the Hyper SQL DELETE command to remove data from a table in the .hyper file.

* __insert_data_into_multiple_tables__
  * This example shows how you can create and insert data into a .hyper file that contains multiple tables. Uses the Inserter class to add data to the tables and a Hyper SQL query to report the number of rows in the tables.

* __insert_data_into_single_table__
  * Demonstrates how you to add data to a single table named Extract that uses the Extract schema. Uses the Inserter class to add data to the table and a Hyper SQL query to report the number of rows in the table.

* __read_and_print_data_from_existing_hyper_file__
  * Demonstrates how to read data from an existing .hyper file and print the output to the console.

* __update_data_in_existing_hyper_file__
  * This example demonstrates how you can use the Hyper SQL UPDATE command to change values in a .hyper file.

* __insert_spatial_data_to_a_hyper_file__
  * This example demonstrates how to insert spatial data (WKT) to a .hyper file

* __insert_data_using_expressions__
  * This examples shows how you can use SQL expressions in Hyper API Inserter to transform or compute data on the fly during data insertion



## How do I install the Hyper API?
It is a prerequisite that to work with these examples, the Hyper API is installed in your language of choice. Head to our [official Hyper API Documentation](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/hyper_api/en-us/docs/hyper_api_installing.html) to get it up and running.



## How do I get help or give feedback?
